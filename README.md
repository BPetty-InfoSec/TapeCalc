# TapeCalc

This is a basic tape calculator for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

## Currently only tested on macOS. Not listed in the app store as of yet.

##At this point, this project is a barely-functional tape calculator.
It works OK, but does not respond to keyboard input as of yet. The math parts work all right, though.

To-Do:
- Add keyboard-awareness so that a numpad can be used.
- Add functionality to the edit button on each roll of the tape so that notations can be made
- Fix up the layout and graphics
- Add the ability to export the tape to a text file
- Ensure that calculator works on iOS
